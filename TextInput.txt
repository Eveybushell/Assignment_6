While sitting on a bench at Carkeek Park, Harriet brought seventy nine apples and ate a baker's dozen while they waited. Eventually, Quinn arrived with 2 cakes from Safeway. While Harriet and Quinn were trading stories, Dani showed up with a blanket, five crepes, and eight pillows. Mindy joined them at the park, bringing their specialty cinnamon rolls, fifteen in number.
